Marriage Contract
This is a smart contract that represents a marriage between two parties on the Ethereum blockchain. It stores the following information:

The state of the marriage (pending or married)
The addresses of the two partners in the marriage
The date and location of the marriage
The address of the NFT (non-fungible token) that represents the wedding picture
The contract has a constructor function that allows you to initialize it with the necessary information. It also has a finalize() function that can be called to set the state of the marriage to "Married".

Usage
To use this contract, you will need to:

Deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix.
Call the constructor function with the addresses of the two partners, the date and location of the marriage, and the address of the wedding picture NFT.
Call the finalize() function to mark the marriage as complete.
Note
This contract is written in Solidity and is intended to be used on the Ethereum blockchain. It is recommended that you have some familiarity with Solidity and the Ethereum ecosystem before attempting to use it.


Prenup Contract
This is a smart contract that represents a prenuptial agreement on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an extension of the Marriage contract, which means it inherits all the functionality and state variables of that contract. In addition to the functionality provided by the Marriage contract, the Prenup contract also has the following features:

Lists of assets and debts that are subject to the prenuptial agreement, stored as mappings with a bytes32 key and a boolean value
Waiver status for each party, indicating whether they have waived their rights under the prenuptial agreement
Functions to add or remove items from the lists of assets and debts
A function for one party to waive their rights under the prenuptial agreement
A function to split assets and debts equally in the event of a divorce or the death of one spouse
Usage
To use this contract, you will need to:

Deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix.
Call the addItem() function to add assets or debts to the lists.
Call the removeItem() function to remove assets or debts from the lists.
Call the waiveRights() function for one or both parties to waive their rights under the prenuptial agreement.
In the event of a divorce or the death of one spouse, call the splitAssetsAndDebts() function to split the assets and debts equally between the two parties.
